# Simple Shopping App
This is a simple shopping application developed for an iOS Developer Home Assignment. The project demonstrates the use of Swift and RxSwift for building a reactive, clean, and maintainable application.

# Features
* Product Catalog: Displays a list of pre-defined products with their prices.
* Shopping Basket: Allows users to add and remove items from a shopping basket.
* Dynamic Currency Conversion: Calculates the total cost of the basket and can convert it to various currencies, with rates loaded from a local JSON file.
* Reactive UI: The entire user interface is driven by a reactive data flow using RxSwift and RxCocoa.

# Technical Stack
* Language: Swift
* Frameworks:
* * RxSwift: For implementing reactive programming patterns.
  * RxCocoa: For providing reactive extensions to UIKit components.

# Project Structure
The project is structured with a focus on separation of concerns and maintainability:

```Product.swift```:  Defines the ```Product``` model.

```CurrencyConverter.swift```: Handles currency conversion logic and loads exchange rates from a JSON file.

```BasketManager.swift```: Manages the state of the shopping basket.

```ShoppingListViewModel.swift```: The ViewModel layer, which contains the core business logic and exposes observables for the UI to bind to.

```ShoppingListViewController.swift```: The View layer, which programmatically builds the UI and binds it to the ViewModel using RxSwift.

```ShoppingListTableViewCell.Swift```: Part of the View layer, contains programatically build cell view for products.

```SceneDelegate.swift```: The application's coordinators set up.

```response.json```: A JSON file that simulates an API response for currency exchange rates.

```UIViewController+Extension.swift```: Contains simple extension to keep displaying UIAlertController under reactive flow.

```AppCoordinator.Swift```: Main coordinator protocol

```ShoppingListCoordinator.swift```: Main app coordinator class that handles creating of main view.

# Setup and Operation
To run this project, you will need Xcode. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/JakubGac/ShopApp.git
```

2. Install Dependencies:
This project uses CocoaPods for dependency management. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```
pod install

```

3. Open the Project:
Open the generated ```.xcworkspace``` file in Xcode.

Run the App:
Select a simulator from the device list in Xcode and click the Run button. The app should compile and launch, displaying the shopping interface.

# Notes
1. The UI is built programmatically without using storyboards or .xib files.
2. Currency rates are sourced from the local ```response.json``` file.
3. The application demonstrates a simple implementation of the MVVM + Coordinators (Model-View-ViewModel plus coordinators for navigation) architectural pattern with a reactive approach and coordinators pattern for navigation.
